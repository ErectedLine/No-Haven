BreachingchargeBaseBuildingPlus is a compatibility extension for Breachingcharge mod. 

It adds compatibility for all BaseBuildingPlus base parts.

Installing this extension should update BreachingCharge1.0.json with all the new classnames, but i recommend deleting the old file and letting the mod generate a new one to be safe. 

By default, Tier 1 (wood) BBP parts can be destroyed with the Homemade Breachingcharge. You need a Heavy Breachingcharge to destroy Tier 2 (metal) BBP parts. Tier 3 (concrete) BBP parts can not be destroyed. This can be adjusted in BreachingCharge1.0.json.
